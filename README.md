# linkedList

#### This repository is for files containing implementations of linked lists in different languages, and some of their useful methods. 

> The original linked list implementation is from Codecademy's Computer Science path and was written in Python. I translated the implementations into Ruby and C# to start, and may add additional languages over time. The process of translating the classes helps me to understand the implementation better, as the different languages force me to think slightly different each time. This project is solely to help further my programming knowledge.
